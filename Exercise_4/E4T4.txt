# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.
Restrict external access to the Web Application instance to use AWS Session Manager.
We could also move the instance into Public Subnet and use Bastion host to access and NAT Gateway for external access to the Internet.

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.
Although VPC private endpoints would restrict traffic to the AWS network, this won't prevent unauthorised access to the secrets S3 bucket if the IAM permissions remain insecure.

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?
No, the files would not be encryted if encryption was previously disabled as when you use server-side encryption, Amazon S3 encrypts an object before saving it to disk and decrypts it when you download the object. 
As of Jan 23, server-side encryption is enabled by AWS as default (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/bucket-encryption.html)

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.
We would lose the security hardening we applied directly to AWS. 
To prevent this, we should update security changes in the CloudFormation template.
