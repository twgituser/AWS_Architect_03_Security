Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.

Security Groups:
WebAppSG allows all internet traffic to access all ports. 
This is identified as an issue with CRITICAL level severity in security hub which states:
Security groups should not allow unrestricted access to ports with high risk

Finding ID: arn:aws:securityhub:us-east-1:398180068381:security-control/EC2.19/finding/0226f0dc-14c5-4f03-9b5d-d006988c310f
Severity = CRITICAL
This control checks whether unrestricted incoming traffic for the security groups is accessible to the specified ports [3389, 20, 23, 110, 143, 3306, 8080, 1433, 9200, 9300, 25, 445, 135, 21, 1434, 4333, 5432, 5500, 5601, 22, 3000, 5000, 8088, 8888] that have the highest risk. 
This control fails if any of the rules in a security group allow ingress traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0 for those ports.

Within Security Hub, it also details specific port vulnerabilities for security groups on PORT 22 and 3389 as HIGH severity.


EC2 Instances:
These are non-compliant as they are configured to support password authentication over SSH. 
Security Manager states:
Password authentication is susceptible to brute-force attacks and should be disabled in favor of key-based authentication where possible.


S3 Buckets:
Although we didn't enable server-side encryption or block public access to the newly created S3 Buckets, 
AWS changed their policies and now enforce both by default since Jan 23 (encryption) and Apr 23 (Block public access), see below for more information:
