Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

Poor practice 1:
The Web Application instance should be moved into the Private Subnet and load balancer configured to only allow access to required ports.
If the web application instance requires internet access (ie for OS patching), we should add a NAT Gateway to the public subnet to provision this.


Poor practice 2:
The security groups and Network ALC rules are allowing unrestricted access to all ports from any source.
They should be changed to restrict allowed traffic to specified ports


Other considerations:

Although there is no encryption specified when creating the S3 Buckets, since Jan. 2023 AWS has applied server side encryption by default
(https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-s3-encrypts-new-objects-by-default/#:~:text=At%20AWS%2C%20security%20is%20the,specify%20a%20different%20encryption%20option)

It is also evident that the Cloudformation Template creates the S3 buckets without blocking Public Access, thankfully since April 2023, AWS also restricts this as default:

Versioning the S3 buckets would help reduce the ability for infiltrators to delete or corrput the objects stored within the S3 buckets.
Client-side encrytion could be used to provide additional security but will make the application code more complex.
